## Getting Started

First of all you need [Microsoft .Net Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/), as editor sugestion [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but it's only a suggestion.

## Cloning the repository

You can clone by https:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danilolutz/CoreZipCode.git
```

Or by SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:danilolutz/CoreZipCode.git
```

What you prefer. Clone the repo and start your work following this steps: 

1. :wrench: Create a new branch based on master 
2. :white_check_mark: Name you branch how you prefer BUT **develop** or **master**
3. :art: Do the best of your art
4. :pencil: Make commit with a clear message
5. :ok_hand: Open a pull request from you new branch to master

We usually use [TDD](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Driven_Development) as development process, just a suggestion. 

**Only thing will be required are the unit tests for new implementations**.

## Testing

You already know how it's works, just add you test class in ```CoreZipCode.Tests``` project implement it, run your tests be sure everything is okay and submit to repo.

## Reporting an Issue

1. Describe what you expected to happen and what actually happens.

2. If possible, include a minimal but complete example to help us reproduce the issue.

3. We'll try to fix it as soon as possible but be in mind that CoreZipCode is open source and you can probably submit a pull request to fix it even faster.

4. Just [open you issue](https://github.com/danilolutz/CoreZipCode/issues/new).
