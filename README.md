## Overview

> **WARNING**: Early stage development. Not for production use yet.

This package is supposed to be used for easily implements address services to yours [Microsoft .Net Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) based software.

Also the **CoreZipCode** are designed to be easily extensible, and if you want, implement your own address services.

## :sunglasses: Get Started

Well, you can download the code and build it by yourself or you can install by [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org) package in: [CoreZipCode Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CoreZipCode/).

Just in case if you doesn't want leave GitHub:

```bash
$ dotnet add package CoreZipCode
```

After you decide how you'll get the CoreZipCode, just inject and use it.

```CSharp
using CoreZipCode.Interfaces;
using CoreZipCode.Services;

namespace YouProject
{
    public YourClass
    {   
        private readonly ZipCodeBaseService _coreZipCode;

        public YourClass(ZipCodeBaseService coreZipCode)
        {
            _coreZipCode = coreZipCode;
        }

        public void YourMethod() 
        {
            var addressByZipCode = _coreZipCode.Execute("14810100");
            var zipCodeByAddress = _coreZipCode.Execute("sp", "araraquara", "barÃ£o do rio");
        }
    }
}
```

> **NOTE**: We have only brazilian address service working out-the-box in this moment. We intent add the USA service coming soon.

### Extending CoreZipCode

Also you can extends ```ZipCodeBaseService``` abstract class and create your own implementation of your prefered address service. Like below:

```CSharp
using CoreZipCode.Interfaces;

namespace CoreZipCode.Services
{
    public class ViaCep : ZipCodeBaseService
    {
        public override string SetZipCodeUrl(string zipcode)
        {
            zipcode = zipcode.Replace("-", "");
            return $"https://viacep.com.br/ws/{zipcode}/json/";    
        }

        public override string SetZipCodeUrlBy(string state, string city, string street) => $"https://viacep.com.br/ws/{state}/{city}/{street}/json/";
    }
}
```
